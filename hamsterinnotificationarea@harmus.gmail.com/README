This extension puts the hamster-tray icon (which you can get via these instructions http://www.janhouse.lv/blog/linux/hamster-time-tracker-in-system-tray/ ) in the notification area of Gnome-shell (top right).

use that script to make it work!!

DO MIND THE UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM ABOUT REMOVING import gnomeapplet FROM applet.py before building hamster
for instructions on building hamster: http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/building-and-running/

The next step will be showing the current task as text in the notification area, like we were used to in Gnome 2.
